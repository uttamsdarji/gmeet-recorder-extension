// speaker-attribution.js - Simplified example for speaker attribution

// Initialize an empty array to store speaker information
const speakers = [];

// Function to attribute speech to a speaker based on simple rules (e.g., alternating turns)
function attributeSpeaker(transcript) {
  // Determine the current speaker based on the last speaker in the list
  const lastSpeaker = speakers[speakers.length - 1];
  let currentSpeaker;

  if (!lastSpeaker) {
    // If there are no previous speakers, start with a default speaker (e.g., "Speaker 1")
    currentSpeaker = "Speaker 1";
  } else {
    // If there was a previous speaker, switch to the other speaker
    currentSpeaker = lastSpeaker === "Speaker 1" ? "Speaker 2" : "Speaker 1";
  }

  // Store the current speaker in the list
  speakers.push(currentSpeaker);

  // Return the current speaker and the transcript
  return { speaker: currentSpeaker, transcript };
}

// Example usage:
const audioTranscript = "Hello, how are you today?";
const attributedSpeech = attributeSpeaker(audioTranscript);
console.log(`Attributed to ${attributedSpeech.speaker}: ${attributedSpeech.transcript}`);
